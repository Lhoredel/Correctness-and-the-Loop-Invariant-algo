# Correctness-and-the-Loop-Invariant-algo
This program uses the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort an integer array in ascending order. It loops through each element beginning at the second position, comparing it with the elements that came before and pushing them to the right until the proper insertion point is located. After fully sorting the array by this cumulative insertion process, it prints out the final sorted result.
